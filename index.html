  <h1>From Eden</h1>
  
  <h4>By Hozier</h4>
  
    <p>Babe. There's something <em>tragic</em> about you. Something so <em>magic</em> about you. Don't you agree?</p>
 
<p>There's something <em>lonesome</em> about you.
Something so <em>wholesome</em> about you. Get closer to <strong>me</strong></p>
    
<p>No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony.
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for <strong>me</strong></p>
    
<p>Honey, you're <strong>familiar</strong> like my mirror years ago.
Idealism sits in prison, <strong>chivalry</strong> fell on its sword.
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know.
I slithered here from <em>Eden</em> just to sit outside your door.</p>
