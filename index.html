  <h1>From Eden</h1>
  
  <h4>By Hozier</h4>
  
    <p>Babe. There's something tragic about you. Something so magic about you. Don't you agree?</p>
 
<p>There's something lonesome about you.
Something so wholesome about you. Get closer to me</p>
    
<p>No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony.
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me.</p>
    
<p>Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago.
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword.
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know.
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door.</p>
